Purpose:
--------

These are templates that allow making high definition time lapse right out of Lightroom preferably together with LRTimelapse

License:
--------

These templates are free to use. However if you use these templates frequently you are kindly asked to make a donation or buy the PRO Templates. You can find the details at http://lrtimelapse.com.

PRO Templates:
-------------

Please note that these free templates have variable bitrates from 12 to 16 Mbps and should get you started and provide pretty good results as well.

However if you are planning to dig deeper into time lapse production you can purchase a "PRO" Set of these templates including a wider range of framerates and much higher bitrates (up to 70mps) at http://lrtimelapse.com/shop for a small fee.
You can find all details at:

The __LRTimelapse_Basic__ Preset will be installed as well.
This develop preset for Lightroom initializes all parameters needed by LRTimelapse.
Use this on your whole Sequence before editing anything (best on import). 
This will get rid of any unset parameters and prevents unexpected results.
